# WELCOME SERIES PROJECT

## Project Overview

A lifestyle brand recently launched a membership/loyalty program and wants
to welcome new members with an engaging three-part email journey. The journey is designed to:
   - Welcome and introduce the program benefits.
   - Educate members about the program features and perks.
   - Encourage members to download the mobile app (only if they haven't already).

The brand wants this journey to be ongoing and only for newly-opted-in members. The journey must be triggered by a daily automation checking for new members who meet the criteria.

The campaign's target audience criteria are as follows: 
- Opted-in Members: Records where OptIn = True.
- New Members (using JoinDate relative to the current date).
- Unique Entries: Exclude members that have already entered the journey.
