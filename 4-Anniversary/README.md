# ANNIVERSARY JOURNEY

## Project Overview

Golden Table, a nationwide restaurant chain with an exclusive membership program, wants to celebrate the one-year membership anniversary of their loyal customers by offering them a personalized discount for their next in-store purchase when they scan their membership card.

The offer must encourage members to visit a store and is valid for one month from the date the email is sent. Discounts vary based on the member's total spend during their first year as a member, making this campaign highly personalized and rewarding.

A reminder email is to be sent out two weeks later for any member that have yet to redeem their discount code.

**Discount Rules:**
The discount percentage depends on the total spend during the one-year membership period:
**Spend Range 1:** $0 - $500 → 10% Discount
**Spend Range 2:** $501 - $1,000 → 15% Discount
**Spend Range 3:** $1,001+ → 20% Discount

**The campaign’s target audience criteria are as follows:**
- Members are to be selected on their 1 year anniversary from member joined date
- Members who opted into email
- Members with at least one transaction made within the first year

**Email Field Requirements:**
- Dynamic Discount Percentage (based on spend range).
- Dynamic Expiration Date (one month after the email is sent).
- Last Store Visited (to encourage them to revisit).
